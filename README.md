# Rubiks-Cube

# About
I have made a 3-D simulator of a Rubiks Cube that you are able to scramble and then solve using the arrow keys and the keyboard. The project used P5JS library to assist with the rendering of the cube. Inspiration for this project was when I was deployed in Iraq and was not able to use electronics much so to pass the time I used a real Rubiks Cube.
