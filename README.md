# Rubiks-Cube

# About
I have made a 3-D simulator of a Rubiks Cube that you are able to scramble and then solve using the arrow keys and the keyboard. The project used P5JS library to assist with the rendering of the cube. Inspiration for this project was when I was deployed in Iraq and was not able to use electronics much so to pass the time I used a real Rubiks Cube.

# Installation
## VS Code
Download all the files into VS Code \
Install extension "Live Server" \
Right click on "index.html" and open with live server

## P5JS Editor
Go to editor.p5js.org \

Click play button in top left

## URL
Go to fahnz.github.io 

# How To Use?
## Controls
Use the left right down and right arrow keys to rotate the cube \
Use "q" "w" "e" "a" "s" "d" to rotate the cube \
Use SHIFT "q" "w" "e" "a" "s" "d" to rotate the cube the opposite way \
Press "Enter" to scramble the cube \

## The Coding Train
I would of not been able to complete this project without the help of Coding Train. His video's do an awesome job explaining how to build a Rubik's cube along with the math behind the rotations and how objects work in 3D space. His video's are below for reference and do a great job at explaining the building of a Rubik's Cube.
